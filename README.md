This is an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, 
using TDD (test-oriented programming) as a working methodology, 
Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, 
always following SOLID principles and, whenever possible, 
applying Design Patterns to solve common problems.
